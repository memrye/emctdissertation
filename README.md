**How to run:**
1. Clone repo
2. Make sure Max 8 is installed
3. Get a [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) 
4. Create a .env file in the repo directory with "GROQ_API_KEY=YOURKEYHERE"
5. NPM install node packages
6. Open start.maxpat, click on large trigger in the top left and turn on audio
